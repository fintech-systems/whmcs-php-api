## v0.1.0 - 2022-10-23

- Added a test for getDomains
- Added GitHub Action workflow for testing. It took hours because of .env issues and the unknown parameters to use. Copied from PayFast and eventually got it working.
- Updated all tests to use mocks
- Updated composer
- Fixed README to specify Pest is actually the test suite
- Fixed the current test suite to a test and a live system. It turns out WHMCS has an inconsistent way of saving telephone numbers, perhaps long ago no spaces but no it auto injects spaces for some countries. USA numbers also seems to selectively have dashes and sometimes not. This means some of the tests could be inconsistent in real-life and on other systems. Got 11 tests working but used data injected from the tests.

## v0.0.5 - 2021-10-27

- refactor to remove return statements in getclientbyphonenumber as return statement might lead to abnormal program termination via the include system

## v0.0.4 - 2021-10-27

- handling of space in telephone numbers

## v0.0.3 - 2021-10-24
